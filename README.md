# Cat vs. Dog Image Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras. The goal is to achieve at least 63% accuracy on the test dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs, divided into training, validation, and test sets. Each set contains images of cats and dogs stored in separate directories.

- **Training set**: Used to train the neural network.
- **Validation set**: Used to evaluate the model's performance during training.
- **Test set**: Used to assess the final performance of the trained model.

## Project Structure
The project includes the following files:
- **cat_vs_dog_classifier.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for building and training the CNN model.
- **README.md**: Markdown file providing an overview of the project, instructions, and additional information.


## Setup
To run the notebook and train the image classifier, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-vs-dog-classifier.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd cat-vs-dog-classifier`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `cat_vs_dog_classifier.ipynb`
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each code cell sequentially.

## Results
The trained model achieved a test accuracy of 64%, surpassing the minimum requirement of 63%. However, further optimization is possible to improve the accuracy even more.

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with different CNN architectures to improve accuracy.
- Explore data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
